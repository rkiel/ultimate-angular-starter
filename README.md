# Starter Seed

A starter project for the Ultimate AngularJS [Starter course](https://courses.toddmotto.com).

### Running this app

All you need to do is run a local server, if you're on OSX you can run a python command from the command line:

```
cd <ultimate-angular-starter-seed>
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

If you're on Windows, you can also download and run python, or if it's easier you can setup a local server by using your favourite IDE.

### Course members

I'd love to see what you've built after mastering the core of AngularJS, consider submitting a PR to this repo to a new branch name (under your chosing). That way, solutions or things you've built after this course would be amazing to see! I wish you luck in your endeavours.

> Non-course members (this project is open source on GitHub)
